# Exporting Sharing Rules B2B Commerce
This repository aims to help you and your team to save time adding sharing rules.

If you manage multiple storefronts and communities, creating sharing rules for every affected B2B Commerce custom object across every community can be a time-consuming task. To more efficiently deploy sharing rules to all of your communities, you can programmatically deploy sharing rules metadata through a command-line tool.

This project is based on Salesforce's suggestion about adding sharing rules programmatically.
